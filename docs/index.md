# Ethereum Smart Contract Security Best Practices

This document provides a baseline knowledge of security considerations for intermediate Solidity programmers. It is maintained by [ConsenSys Diligence](https://consensys.net/diligence/), with contributions from our friends in the broader Ethereum community.

Our amazing community has also provided translations in [Chinese](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/blob/master/README-zh.md) and [Vietnamese](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/blob/master/README-vi.md).

## Where to start?

* [General Philosophy](./general_philosophy.md) describes the smart contract security mindset
* [Smart Contract Recommendations](./recommendations.md) contains examples of good code patterns
* [Known Attacks](./known_attacks.md) describes the different classes of vulnerabilities to avoid
* [Software Engineering](./software_engineering.md) outlines some architectural and design approaches for risk mitigation
* [Tokens](./tokens.md) outlines best practices specifically related to Tokens.
* [Documentation and Procedures](./documentation_procedures.md) outlines best practices for documenting your system for other developers and auditors
* [Security Tools](./security_tools.md) lists tools for improving code quality, and detecting vulnerabilities
* [Bug Bounties](./bug_bounty_list.md) List of bug bounties in the ecosystem.

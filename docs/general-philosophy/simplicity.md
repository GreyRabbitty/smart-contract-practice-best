Complexity increases the likelihood of errors.

- Ensure the contract logic is simple
- Modularize code to keep contracts and functions small
- Use already-written tools or code where possible (eg. don't roll your own random number
  generator)
- Prefer clarity to performance whenever possible
- Only use the blockchain for the parts of your system that require decentralization

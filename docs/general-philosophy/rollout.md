    For comprehensive insights into secure development practices, consider visiting the [Development Recommendations](https://scsfg.io/developers/) section of the Smart Contract Security Field Guide. This resource provides in-depth articles to guide you in developing robust and secure smart contracts.

It is always better to catch bugs before a full production release.

- Test contracts thoroughly, and add tests whenever new attack vectors are discovered
- Provide [bug bounties](../bug-bounty-programs.md) starting from alpha testnet
  releases
- Rollout in phases, with increasing usage and testing in each phase

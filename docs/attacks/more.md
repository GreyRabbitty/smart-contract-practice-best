The [Smart Contract Weakness Classification Registry](https://smartcontractsecurity.github.io/SWC-registry/)
offers a complete and up-to-date catalogue of known smart contract vulnerabilities and
anti-patterns along with real-world examples. Browsing the registry is a good way of keeping
up-to-date with the latest attacks. It has been proposed formally in [EIP-1470](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1469) and is loosely aligned with the Common Weakness Enumeration ([CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/)).

Additionally, the [Smart Contract Security Verification Standard (SCSVS)](https://github.com/securing/SCSVS) contains a checklist-style collection of vital security properties aimed at standardizing the security of smart contracts for developers, architects, security reviewers and vendors.

**Disassemblers**

Tools that translate smart contract bytecode into opcodes or EVM assembly.

- [Ethersplay](https://github.com/crytic/ethersplay) - Binary Ninja plugin which enables an EVM disassembler and related analysis tools. 
- [Pyevmasm](https://github.com/crytic/pyevmasm) - Assembler and disassembler library for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It includes a commandline utility and a Python API.
- [IDA-EVM](https://github.com/crytic/ida-evm) - IDA Processor Module for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- [Ethereum DASM](https://github.com/tintinweb/ethereum-dasm) - EVM bytecode disassembler with function signature lookup plus static and dynamic analysis.

**Decompilers**

As above but translated into more readable Solidity-like code.

- [JEB Ethereum Smart Contract Decompiler](https://www.pnfsoftware.com/blog/ethereum-smart-contract-decompiler/) - JEB decompiler plugin for Ethereum Smart Contracts
- [Online Solidity Decompiler](https://ethervm.io/decompile) - Online tool that decompiles Ethereum contract bytecode into more readable Solidity-like code, allowing for better understanding of opaque/unverified contracts.
- [Dedaub Decompiler](https://library.dedaub.com/decompile) - EVM bytecode decompiler and disassembler hybrid with 3 address code view deployed on a website.

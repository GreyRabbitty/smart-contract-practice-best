Generally speaking, smart contracts of tokens should follow an accepted and stable standard.

Examples of currently accepted standards include:

- [EIP20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md)
- [EIP721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) (non-fungible token)

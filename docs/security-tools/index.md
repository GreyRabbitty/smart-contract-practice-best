| [Visualization](./visualization.md)                             | These tools are aimed at visualizing, EVM bytecode, smart contracts, and their control flow graphs. |
| [Static and Dynamic Analysis](./static-and-dynamic-analysis.md) | Tools that employ various means of program analysis to find vulnabilities and weaknesses.           |
| [Classification](./classification.md)                           | Resources attempting to classify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in smart contracts.                 |
| [Testing](./testing.md)                                         | Tools for running, measuring, and managing smart contract related tests                             |
| [Linters and Formatters](./linters-and-formatters.md)           | Any tools that highlight code smells and make smart contract code adhere to format standards.       |

## Future improvements
- **Editor Security Warnings**: Editors will soon alert for common security errors, not just compilation errors. Browser Solidity is getting these features soon.

- **New functional languages that compile to EVM bytecode**: Functional languages gives certain guarantees over procedural languages like Solidity, namely immutability within a function and strong compile time checking. This can reduce the risk of errors by providing deterministic behavior.

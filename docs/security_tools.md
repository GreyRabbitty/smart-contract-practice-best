### Test Coverage

- [solidity-coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage) - Code coverage for Solidity testing.


### Linters

Linters improve code quality by enforcing rules for style and composition, making code easier to read and review.

- [Solcheck](https://github.com/federicobond/solcheck) - A linter for Solidity code written in JS and heavily inspired by eslint.
- [Solint](https://github.com/weifund/solint) - Solidity linting that helps you enforce consistent conventions and avoid errors in your Solidity smart-contracts.
- [Solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium) - Yet another Solidity linting.
- [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint) - A linter for Solidity that provides both Security and Style Guide validations.

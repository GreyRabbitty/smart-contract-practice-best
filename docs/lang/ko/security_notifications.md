This is a list of resources that will often highlight discovered exploits in Ethereum or Solidity. The official source of security notifications is the Ethereum Blog, but in many cases, vulnerabilities will be disclosed and discussed earlier in other locations.

- [Ethereum Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/): The official Ethereum blog
  - [Ethereum Blog - Security only](https://blog.ethereum.org/category/security/): All blog posts that are tagged *Security*
- [Ethereum Gitter](https://gitter.im/orgs/ethereum/rooms) chat rooms
  - [Solidity](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
  - [Go-Ethereum](https://gitter.im/ethereum/go-ethereum)
  - [CPP-Ethereum](https://gitter.im/ethereum/cpp-ethereum)
  - [Research](https://gitter.im/ethereum/research)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum)
- [Network Stats](https://ethstats.net/)

It's highly recommended that you *regularly* read all these sources, as exploits they note may impact your contracts.

Additionally, here is a list of Ethereum core developers who may write about security, and see the [bibliography](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices#smart-contract-security-bibliography) for more from the community.

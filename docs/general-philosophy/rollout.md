It is always better to catch bugs before a full production release.

- Test contracts thoroughly, and add tests whenever new attack vectors are discovered
- Provide [bug bounties](../bug-bounty-programs.md) starting from alpha testnet
  releases
- Rollout in phases, with increasing usage and testing in each phase

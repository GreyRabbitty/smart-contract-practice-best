Ethereum and complex blockchain programs are new and highly experimental. Therefore, you should
expect constant changes in the security landscape, as new bugs and security risks are discovered,
and new best practices are developed. Following the security practices in this document is
therefore only the beginning of the security work you will need to do as a smart contract
developer.

Smart contract programming requires a different engineering mindset than you may be used to. The
cost of failure can be high, and change can be difficult, making it in some ways more similar to
hardware programming or financial services programming than web or mobile development. It is
therefore not enough to defend against known vulnerabilities. Instead, you will need to learn a new
philosophy of development:

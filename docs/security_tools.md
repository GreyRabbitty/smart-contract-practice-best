### Visualization

- [SÅ«rya](https://github.com/ConsenSys/surya) - Utility tool for smart contract systems, offering a number of visual outputs and information about the contracts' structure. Also supports querying the function call graph.
- [Solgraph](https://github.com/raineorshine/solgraph) - Generates a DOT graph that visualizes function control flow of a Solidity contract and highlights potential security vulnerabilities.
- [EVM Lab](https://github.com/ethereum/evmlab) - Rich tool package to interact with the EVM. Includes a VM, Etherchain API, and a trace-viewer.
- [ethereum-graph-debugger](https://github.com/fergarrui/ethereum-graph-debugger) - A graphical EVM debugger. Displays the entire program control flow graph.

### Static and Dynamic Analysis

- [Securify](https://securify.chainsecurity.com/) - Fully automated online static analyzer for smart contracts, providing a security report based on vulnerability patterns. 
- [SmartCheck](https://tool.smartdec.net) - Static analysis of Solidity source code for security vulnerabilities and best practices.
- [Octopus](https://github.com/quoscient/octopus) - Security Analysis tool for Blockchain Smart Contracts with support of EVM and (e)WASM.

### Weakness OSSClassifcation & Test Cases
- [SWC-registry](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/SWC-registry/) - SWC definitions and a large repository of crafted and real-world samples of vulnerable smart contracts. 
- [SWC Pages](https://smartcontractsecurity.github.io/SWC-registry/) - The SWC-registry repo published on Github Pages

### Test Coverage

- [solidity-coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage) - Code coverage for Solidity testing.

### Linters

Linters improve code quality by enforcing rules for style and composition, making code easier to read and review.

- [Solcheck](https://github.com/federicobond/solcheck) - A linter for Solidity code written in JS and heavily inspired by eslint.
- [Solint](https://github.com/weifund/solint) - Solidity linting that helps you enforce consistent conventions and avoid errors in your Solidity smart-contracts.
- [Solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium) - Yet another Solidity linting.
- [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint) - A linter for Solidity that provides both Security and Style Guide validations.

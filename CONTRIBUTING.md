### Layout and Compilation

All files are in the `src` folder; they are compiled to the main `README.md` by running `make`

### Audience

- Write for an intermediate Ethereum developer, they know the basics of Solidity programming and have coded a number of contracts

### Style Guidelines

#### General

- *Favor succinctness in writing*
  - use max 3-4 sentences in a sectin (exceptions can be made when critical)
  - Show, donâ€™t tell (examples speak more than lengthy exposition)
  - Include a simple, illustrative example rather than complex examples that require substantial, extraneous reading
- *Add a source link to the original document when available*
- *Create new sections when warranted*
- *Keep lines under 80 characters when possible*
- Use the format of the [Airbnb Javascript Style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) as a starting point

#### Recommendations Section

- Always favor a declarative tip starting with a verb for the section title
- Include an example of good and bad examples

#### Attacks Section

- Typically provide an example - then point to a recommendation for the solution in the relevant section of the doc
- List first/most visible attack, where possible

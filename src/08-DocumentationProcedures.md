## Security-related Documentation and Procedures
When launching a contract that will have substantial funds or is required to be mission critical, it is important to include proper documentation. Some documentation related to security includes:

**Status**

- Current status of deployed code (including outstanding issues, performance stats, etc.)

**Known Issues**

- Key risks with contract
- e.g., You can lose all your money, hacker can vote for certain outcomes
- All known bugs/limitations
- Potential attacks and mitigants
- Potential conflicts of interest (e.g., will be using yourself, like Slock.it did with the DAO)

**History**

- Testing (including usage stats, discovered bugs, length of testing)
- People who have reviewed code (and their key feedback)

**Procedures**

- Notification process if bug is discovered
- Wind down process if something goes wrong (e.g., funders will get percentage of your balance before attack, from remaining funds)
- If hacker bounty*provided for discovered bugs, responsible disclosure policy, where to report, etc
- Recourse in case of failure (e.g., insurance, penalty fund, no recourse)

**Contact Information**

- Who to contact with issues
- Names of programmers and/or other important parties

| Visualization               | These tools are aimed at visualizing, EVM bytecode, smart contracts, and their control flow graphs. |
| Static and Dynamic Analysis | Tools that employ various means of program analysis to find vulnabilities and weaknesses.           |
| Classification              | Resources attempting to classify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in smart contracts.                 |
| Testing                     | Tools for running, measuring, and managing smart contract related tests                             |
| Linters and Formatters      | Any tools that highlight code smells and make smart contract code adhere to format standards.       |

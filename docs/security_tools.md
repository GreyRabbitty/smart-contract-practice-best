### Static Analysis

- [Manticore](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore) - Dynamic binary analysis tool with [EVM support](https://asciinema.org/a/haJU2cl0R0Q3jB9wd733LVosL)
- [Mythril Platform API](https://mythril.ai/) - SaaS platform and tools ecosystem for smart contract security.
- [Mythril OSS](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril) - Open-source security analysis tool for Solidity code and Ethereum bytecode.
- [Oyente](https://github.com/melonproject/oyente) - Analyze Ethereum code to find common vulnerabilities, based on this [paper](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~loiluu/papers/oyente.pdf).
- [Solgraph](https://github.com/raineorshine/solgraph) - Generates a DOT graph that visualizes function control flow of a Solidity contract and highlights potential security vulnerabilities.
- [SmartCheck](https://tool.smartdec.net) - Static analysis of Solidity source code for security vulnerabilities and best practices.
- [Securify](https://securify.ch/) - Fully automated online static analyzer for smart contracts, providing a security report based on vulnerability patterns. 
- [SÅ«rya](https://github.com/ConsenSys/surya) - Utility tool for smart contract systems, offering a number of visual outputs and information about the contracts' structure. Also supports querying the function call graph.
- [EVM Lab](https://github.com/ethereum/evmlab) - Rich tool package to interact with the EVM. Includes a VM, Etherchain API, and a trace-viewer.
- [Slither](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither) - Static analysis framework with detectors for many common Solidity issues. It has taint and value tracking capabilities and is written in Python.

### Test Coverage

- [solidity-coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage) - Code coverage for Solidity testing.

### Linters

Linters improve code quality by enforcing rules for style and composition, making code easier to read and review.

- [Solcheck](https://github.com/federicobond/solcheck) - A linter for Solidity code written in JS and heavily inspired by eslint.
- [Solint](https://github.com/weifund/solint) - Solidity linting that helps you enforce consistent conventions and avoid errors in your Solidity smart-contracts.
- [Solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium) - Yet another Solidity linting.
- [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint) - A linter for Solidity that provides both Security and Style Guide validations.

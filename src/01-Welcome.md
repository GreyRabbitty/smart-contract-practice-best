# Ethereum Contract Security Techniques and Tips

[The DAO](https://github.com/slockit/DAO), a crowdfunded investment contract that had substantial security flaws, highlights the importance of security and proper software engineering of blockchain-based contracts. This document outlines collected security tips and techniques for smart contract development. This material is provided as is - and may not reflect best practice. Pull requests are welcome.

**Currently, this document is an early draft - and likely has substantial omissions or errors. This message will be removed in the future once a number of community members have reviewed this document.**

#### Note for contributors

This document is designed to provide a starting security baseline for intermediate Solidity programmers. It includes security philosophies, code idioms, known attacks, and software engineering techniques for blockchain contract programming - and aims to cover all communities, techniques, and tools that improve smart contract security. At this stage, this document is focused primarily on Solidity, a javascript-like language for Ethereum, but other languages are welcome.

#### Additional Requested Content

We especially welcome content in the following areas:

- Testing Solidity code (structure, frameworks, common test idioms)
- Software engineering practices for smart contracts and/or blockchain-based programming
